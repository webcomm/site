// Settings for Foundation and third party

// approach that can't be said for several other CSS frameworks.

// Font Awesome is a vector-based (using web fonts) icon library that ships
// with enough icons for almost any scenario. It's integration with SCSS
// is less than optimal, leading to abiguous "import" declarations.

// Layouts are responsible for the majority of the structure of the website,
// including such things as responsive adapation of headers, columns, etc.
// Layouts are not styles for individual components, that's for modules.

// Modules are the reusable "building blocks" of the website. They are
// intended to be flexible enough to sit anywhere in the layout, so
// it's important to thing "agnostic" when developing these.

// Shame is a great place for browser hacks and things you don't want the

// pieces here you can find no other clean way to solve.
